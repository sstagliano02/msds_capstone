# Capstone Tracker

## 2024-06-01
-Set up markdown file to track Capstone progress. Would like to improve on soft-technical skills through this Status Report vs using a simple Google Doc <br>
-Set up Github repository for project <br>
-Practiced pushing changes from local file to GitHub, using VSCode <br>
-I struggled with the initial set up and cloning, but eventually succeeded in being able to update this markdown file and push directly to the GitHub page <br>
-**Goal for next sprint**: Assemble Mission Statement and Requirements Slides <br>

-**Mission Statement:  Sharpen big data and machine learning skills by ingesting earnings call transcripts and creating an "uncertainty" dictionary via neural networks, using Paul Soto's previous work as guideline.** <br>
-Ultimately I want to recreate the first half of Paul Soto's work, which uses the Skip Gram Word Embedding technique to find words in close "proximity" to the seed word "Uncertainty". This forms the basis of the dictionary from which to score transcript uncertainty. <br>
-Given time I would also like to see how transcript uncertainty scores impact future loan/deposit movements.<br>

## 2024-06-11
-Refamiliarized myself with the source paper: Soto, Paul. Breaking the Word Bank: Measurement and Effects of Bank Level Uncertainty. Journal of Financial Services Research, 59:1â€“45, 2020. (December 1, 2019). (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347329)<br>
-Focused on understanding how the Word Embedding was done to ensure machine learning algorithms are reproducible. <br>
-[Requirements Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kJGZvuGkIB1E4net2ipg81y3v-zn55AepvC93jrRlPs/edit#slide=id.p) ,br.
-**Goal for next sprint**: Kick off process of getting transcript dataset from S&P Global downloaded to personal laptop and practice basic SQL queries to pull data.
